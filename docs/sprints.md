# Things to Do Before, During, and After Every Sprint

This project is iterated on with two-week sprints. During those two weeks, issues are created and tracked within GitHub. At the end of each sprint, these things should happen:

- The changelog should be updated with an overview of what happened during the sprint.
- A sentence detailing how many tickets of each kind were completed during the sprint should be added to the changelog.
- A new section should be added to the changelog that sets up the upcoming sprint.
- The version number should be updated in the package.json file.
- A new release branch should be made from the develop branch with the new version number.
- A tag should be added to the new release branch.
- The release branch should be pushed remotely.
- A new kanban board should be made in GitHub that represents the new sprint, and all unfinished issues should be moved to this board.
