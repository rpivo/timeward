# App

## Arguments
`App` does not take in any props.

## State

#### isAuthorized: Boolean
`isAuthorized` indicates whether the user is an authorized user. Passing this state down to children will result in specific UI for authorized and non-authorized users.

## Example Usage
`App` is a top-level, single-use component. `isAuthorized` is initialized as `false`. `App` wraps a `Header` component as well as `Route` components, including a special `Route` component called `PrivateRoute` that takes in state `isAuthorized` to determine whether the user can view the route. `App` passes `setIsAuthorized`, the setter for `isAuthorized` down to the `Login` page where the state value can then be set.

```tsx
const App: React.FC = (): JSX.Element => {
  const [isAuthorized, setIsAuthorized] = useState(false);

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={Theme}>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <div className='app'>
        <Router>
          <Header isAuthorized={isAuthorized} />
          <Page>
            <Switch>
              <Route
                path="/login"
                render={(): JSX.Element => <Login setIsAuthorized={setIsAuthorized} />}
              />
              <PrivateRoute isAuthorized={isAuthorized} path="*" component={Dashboard} />
            </Switch>
          </Page>
        </Router>
      </div>
    </ThemeProvider>

  );
};
```
