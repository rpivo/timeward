# timeward
### productivity for perfectionists.

Timeward is a productivity tool designed to help people manage their time better, and to help make the progress in that time more meaningful.

Features will include time tracking, project management, reminders, calendar integration, and task/to-do management.

"Timeward" is a portmanteau of the words "time" and "forward". Arguably the most valuable resource we are given is time, and time is perpetually moving forward, whether we like it or not. In trying to wrangle in the time that we have, we sometimes get bogged down by the details we may have forgotten. We get thrown off by events we didn't foresee. Timeward is designed to be a failsafe for these moments.

### Toolchain

Under the hood, Timeward is built with a number of tools, including **Jest** for testing, **React** for UI development, **Webpack** for bundling, **ESLint** for linting, and TypeScript for scalability and additional programming language functionality.
